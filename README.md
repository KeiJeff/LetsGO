Description

 
A1

Develop both an implementation of both algorithms as both message passing and shared memory implementations 

Compare the execution time of these algorithms and display the generate results, investigate how the reduction of 
 
usable cores may effect the various execution times

Submit requirements

1.       Source code

2.       Video presentation of walk through with execution (max 9 min)

3.       Interview on project
